# LatinR 2024 Tutorial --  Working with larger than memory data in R with Arrow and DuckDB

This tutorial holds the dataset used for the tutorial. The dataset is small
sample of the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files
that has been prepared by Nic Crane, Jonathan Keane, and Neal Richardson for
their book "[Scaling Up With R and Arrow](https://arrowrbook.com/)". Many of the
code examples used in this tutorial have been inspired by the ones used in their
book.


Once the tutorial is over, a file named `solutions.R` will be added to the
repository with the code used in the tutorial, and a link to the slideshow will
also be added.
